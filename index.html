          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
             morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. 
             Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take 
             place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be 
             considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Grow is most often used as an intransitive verb, as in The corn grew fast or Our business has been
             growing steadily for 10 years. This use dates back to the Middle Ages. In the 1700s, a transitive sense arose with the meaning "to 
             produce or cultivate," as in We grow corn in our garden. Then, starting in the late 1900s, people began to use grow with a nonliving 
             thing or even an abstraction as the direct object, often in the context of politics or business, as in One of our key strategies is 
             to grow our business by increasing the number of clients. This trend was widely criticized. In 1992, only 20 percent of the Usage 
             Panel accepted the sentence above, and only 48 percent accepted We've got to grow our way out of this recession. These usages remain 
             common, however, and resistance to them has lessened: in 2014, 60 percent of the Panel accepted the grow our business sentence, and
              65 percent accepted the grow our way out of the recession sentence. But Panelists strongly frown upon the phrase grow down, probably
              because it seems oxymoronic: 96 percent of the Panel found it unacceptable.</p>

              freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases of
